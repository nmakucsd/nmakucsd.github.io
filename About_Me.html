                <!--paragraph element-->
                <p>I was born and raised in San Francisco, California with exposure to a diverse amount of culture. Through my family, I was raised with a intricate background of Kung Fu.</p>

                <p>For high school, I enrolled in San Francisco's Ruth Asawa School of the Arts as a World Music major. </p>
                <p>While my high school was rich in opportunity for the arts, there was an imbalance. All the emphasis for the arts meant a lack of focus for STEM education. To supplement my passion for Engineering at the time, I decided to start the school's first robotics team. Initially it was difficult to get support, but when the word spread, likeminded students began to follow. </p>

                <p>For university, I was fortunate enough to be accepted into University of California, San Diego as a computer science major. For my first year, I wanted to allow myself to explore university life. As a result, I joined various social organizations like UCSD KASA and a dance team, Sleepless Collective. </p>
                <p>My second year of university, I decided to return to the world of STEM by joining engineering societies like IEEE, ACM, and Triton XR and applying to various staff positions to promote my involvement. </p>
