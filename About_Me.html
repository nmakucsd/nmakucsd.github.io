                <h2 class="about-section">Early Life</h2>
                
                <p>I was born and raised in San Francisco, California with exposure to a diverse amount of culture. Through my family, I was 
                raised with a intricate background and diverse background of martial arts.</p>
                <img class="float-image-left" src="Images/Childhood_Germany.JPG" width="300">
               
                
                <p>The family culture of Kung Fu in my family, came from my grandfather's inspiring legacy as an ambassador and teacher 
                in martial arts and medicine. The legacy he left behind, includes the knowledge he instilled in many disciples currently 
                located worldwide in countries from Germany to Singapore and Hong Kong. Among these legacies, is my father. When I was 
                young, my father would frequently scout and invit people related to this lineage in the Kung Fu community from China and 
                Hong Kong over to our house to teach me various Kung Fu forms. From the basics to traditional, the forms I learned would 
                gradually expand my involvement in the community. As I developed my knowledge and experience in martial arts, I went on 
                to achieve many accomplishments like receiving a 3rd Dan Black Belt in Hapkido to winning 1st place in an international 
                Kung Fu competition in the Netherlands.</p>
                
                <img class="float-image-right" src="Images/World Music.jpeg" width="300">
                <p>For high school, I enrolled in San Francisco's Ruth Asawa School of the Arts as a World Music major. The high school I 
                enrolled in was different from the other high schools in the San Francisco Unified School District. Unlike the other schools, 
                SOTA offered its general education academics in the the morning, and 2-3 hours of visual/performing arts in the afternoon. My 
                World Music department provided me a multicultural musical education in which I learned from local and international 
                professionals. Within the years I had with the department, I refined my knowledge in musicianship and composition, while 
                learning new skills in dance and performance.</p> <br>



                <img class="float-image-left" src="Images/2019 Robot.jpg" width="300">
                <p>While my high school was rich in opportunity for the arts, there was an imbalance. All the emphasis for the arts meant a 
                lack of focus for STEM education, a career path I was interested in. To supplement my passion for Engineering at the time, 
                I decided to start the school's <i>FIRST</i> robotics team. Initially it was difficult to find support, because no one knew 
                about the idea I had. But when the word spread, other students with similar interests came. The team started with just me 
                attempting to fundraise the registration fee of $6,000. Luckily, with the aid of a grant I applied for and the school's 
                administration, I was able to begin my endeavors. Building the <img class="float-image-right" src="Images/2019-Winner.jpg" width="300">
                team's first year robot was tough. If it weren't for the help 
                of the dedicated members and experienced parents, the team would not have had a functioning robot at all. While the robot did 
                not do so well in competition the first year, it was an worthy accomplishment for the team nonetheless. In the following years, 
                the team caught on successfully and expanded to 40+ members, becoming the largest organization in the school. From the founding 
                team, I learned many skills from CAD, machining, Java robotics programming, electrical engineering, and business development. 
                Currently, <a href="http://www.team5700.org/" target=_blank>Team 5700: SOTA Cyberdragons</a> is thriving in the world of <i>FIRST</i> Robotics, 
                winning San Francisco Regional 2019, winning Chezy Champs 2019 and competing in the international <i>FIRST</i> championships in 
                Houston, Texas.</p> <br>

                <h2 class="about-section">UNIVERSITY</h2>
                

                <p> For university, I was fortunate enough to be accepted into University of California, San Diego as a computer science major. 
                For my first year, I wanted to allow myself to explore university life and discover alternative opportunities now available to me 
                as a university student. As a result, I joined various social organizations like UCSD KASA, Sleepless Collective Dance Team. and 
                KOTX UCSD.</p>
                
                <p>In Sleepless Collective, I was able to continue my passion in dance and performance that I first found in high school as a World 
                Music major. What made Sleepless Collective unique to the other dance teams on campus was it's special emphasis in freestyle 
                and choreography. Being one of the competitive teams as well, I was able to travel and compete with the team on stage as well.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Caught up in the Korean wave, I also became a media producer staff in UCSD's K-Pop community organization, KOTX UCSD. Through KOTX,
                I honed my skills in Adobe Suite editing graphics and videos. Through this experience, I also developed a passion in video special 
                effects which has changed my career path to computer graphics.</p> <br>
                
                <h2 class="about-section">PRESENT</h2>


                <p>With my second year of university, I decided to return to the world of STEM by joining engineering societies like IEEE, ACM, and 
                Triton XR and applying to various staff positions to promote my involvement. In IEEE I became a project lead for it's new annual 
                project, Robocup Soccer. In Triton XR, I became a project lead assistant so I could get more involved in the creation of virtual 
                reality projects, a topic that has piqued my career interests.</p> <br>
