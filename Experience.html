                    <p>In my second year of university, I joined UCSD's IEEE Engineering Society as a project lead for one of their annual 
                        projects, Robocup Soccer. The goal of the team in the first quarter was to develop a functioning prototype so the entire team 
                        could potentially qualify for internationals. Using the experience I had developed from FIRST Robotics, I lead my division to 
                        develop the intial hardware of the robot. Due to the time constraints of the first quarter, my division teamed up with other divisions 
                        to work on different aspects of the robot; because my division was already advanced in progress on the hardware, we decided to focus 
                        on the hardware of the robot while the other teams developed the programming and electronics.

                    <p> 
                        With my prior experience in robotics competitions and robotics programming completed as I enrolled 
                        in UCSD, I decided I wanted to get back into the robotics competition field. Robolink offered a position 
                        as a robotics instructor to teach kids not only the basics of programming through robots, but also the 
                        many experiences and joys it offers from simplying seeing something move to the excitement of competitions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Robolink, provided an opportunity for its students to participate in VEX IQ, an international robotics 
                        competition for kids in elementary and middle school. As a coach/instructor, I have to teach my students 
                        how to build a proper robot with common robotics concepts, how to program it, and help them practice playing the game.

                    <p>
                        While my high school was rich in opportunity for the arts, there was an imbalance. All the emphasis for the arts meant a 
                        lack of focus for STEM education, a career path I was interested in. To supplement my passion for Engineering at the time, 
                        I decided to start the school's <i>FIRST</i> robotics team. Initially it was difficult to find support, because no one knew 
                        about the idea I had. But when the word spread, other students with similar interests came. The team started with just me 
                        attempting to fundraise the registration fee of $6,000. Luckily, with the aid of a grant I applied for and the school's 
                        administration, I was able to begin my endeavors. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Building the team's first year robot was tough. If it weren't for the help 
                        of the dedicated members and experienced parents, the team would not have had a functioning robot at all. While the robot did 
                        not do so well in competition the first year, it was an worthy accomplishment for the team nonetheless. In the following years, 
                        the team caught on successfully and expanded to 40+ members, becoming the largest organization in the school. From the founding

                    <p> 
                        Although, I was applying to a lot of Computer Science related internships at the time, I figured 
                        university was the optimal time for me to get the experience in a ramen restaurant's kitchen that 
                        I've had thoughts about. I knew that somewhere down the line, I would want to start a ramen chain 
                        business because I have had a reoccuring passion for ramen since I was a kid, so I decided to ask 
                        around local restaurants for a position in the kitchen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite my lack of experience, Tajima offered me a position in the kitchen. Although I started my 
                        first day as a dishwasher, I believe the head chef saw my passion for the kitchen, because it wasn't 
                        long after that he taught me more. I hope to learn as much as I can while I'm with Tajima, so I can 
                        bring my dreams of being a ramen chef to life.

                    <p> 
                        My journey in Hapkido USA began when I was 7. My father enrolled me as a student because I got in a 
                        fight at school with 5th graders as a kindergartener, and I didn't know how to protect myself. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After many years, I eventually became a 3rd Dan Black belt and took on the role of an instructor. 
                        Initially with my experience with harsh teachers in Kung Fu, I acted as a strict teacher to 
                        command attention. However, I eventually realized that the enforcing would grow mentally draining, 
                        and completely unnecessary. Instead, I adapted to learn to communicate with the kid students as if 
                        they were adults with rational mentalities. By giving them the respect they deserve until proven 
                        otherwise, I realized that the kid students were able to perform just as well as when I was a stricter 
                        communicator. 
                    </p>

                        With the experience as an instructor for students of all ages for three years, a lot of opportunities opened 
                        for me with my leadership abilities, communication, and other soft skills.
